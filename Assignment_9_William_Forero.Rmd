## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
```

In an attempt to protect the API key I have set my system environment with the key under NYT_API, then I will use getenv to pull the key

```{r}
# Getting the API key and assigning it to a variable
key <- Sys.getenv("NYT_API")
```


This is my api call to the NYT best sellers list hitory
```{r}
api_results <- GET(
  url = "https://api.nytimes.com/svc/books/v3/lists/best-sellers/history.json",
  query = list(
    author = "John Green",
    `api-key` = key
  )
)

api_results
```
I am parsing the json data that is pulled from my api call
```{r}
json_results <- content(api_results, as = "parsed", simplifyVector = FALSE)

```

Then assigning those results below which will be used shortly by running it through a function which maps certain desired fields to their respective columns in my R dataframe
```{r}
john_green_res <- json_results$results
```

I am defining a function below that will pull in the different books John Green may have had on the list. 

I am creating a total weeks on the list to see if the books ranked for multiple weeks or not. The highest rank pulls the min rank from the rank history since NYT ranks 1 being the best, or "highest" rank. If the book did not rank then there is an NA
```{r}
extract_books <- function(extract_book) {
  tibble(
    title = extract_book$title,
    author = extract_book$author,
    contributor = extract_book$contributor,
    publisher = extract_book$publisher,
    description = extract_book$description,
    total_weeks_on_list = if (length(extract_book$ranks_history) > 0)
      max(map_int(extract_book$ranks_history, "weeks_on_list"))
    else NA,
    highest_rank = if (length(extract_book$ranks_history) > 0)
      min(map_int(extract_book$ranks_history, "rank"))
    else NA,
    lowest_rank = if (length(extract_book$ranks_history) > 0)
      max(map_int(extract_book$ranks_history, "rank"))
    else NA
  )
}
```

Here we see the mapped dataframe that results from running the api results through the function
```{r}
john_green_df <- map_df(john_green_res, extract_books)
john_green_df
```

Here we can see that "The Anthropocene Reviewed" was John Greens book with the most weeks on the NYT bestseller list.
```{r}
longest_rank <- john_green_df |>
  filter(!is.na(total_weeks_on_list) & total_weeks_on_list > 0) |>
  select(title, 
         author, 
         contributor, 
         publisher, 
         total_weeks_on_list,
         highest_rank,
         lowest_rank) |>
  arrange(desc(total_weeks_on_list))
longest_rank
```

The book that placed at the highest rank however was "Everything is Tuberculosis"
```{r}
highest_rank <- john_green_df |>
  filter(!is.na(highest_rank)) |>
  select(title, 
         author, 
         contributor, 
         publisher, 
         total_weeks_on_list,
         highest_rank,
         lowest_rank) |>
  arrange((highest_rank))
highest_rank
```
